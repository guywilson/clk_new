.SH NAME
clk \- cloak
.SH SYNOPSIS
clk [merge|extract] [\f[I]options\f[R]] file
.SH DESCRIPTION
Hide and extract an encrypted file within an RGB (24\-bit) PNG image.
.PP
The idea is simple, a 24\-bit colour PNG image uses 3 bytes for each
pixel in the image, one each for the Red, Green and Blue channels, so
each colour channel is represented by a value between 0 \- 255.
If we encode a file in the least significant bits (LSBs) of the image
data, there will be no visible difference in the image when displayed.
At an encoding depth of 1\-bit per byte, we need 8 bytes of image data
to encode 1 byte of our file.
.SH OPTIONS
\f[B]\-h, \-host [host file]\f[R]
.PP
Specifies the filename of the host.
Currently, clk only supports 24\-bit PNG images.
That is PNG images that store their image data with 8\-bits per colour
channel (RGB).
.PP
\f[B]\-algo [encryption algorithm]\f[R]
.PP
The algorithm used to encrypt your file prior to merging with the host
file and decrypt after extracting.
It can be one of the following:
.IP \(bu 2
aes256 \- encrypt using the AES\-256 algorithm in CBC mode
.IP \(bu 2
aes \- an alias for aes256
.IP \(bu 2
xor \- encrypt using XOR encryption
.IP \(bu 2
otp \- an alias for xor
.IP \(bu 2
none \- no encryption (just hide)
.IP \(bu 2
no \- an alias for none
.PP
If \-algo aes256 is specified, the user will be prompted to enter a
password.
.PP
If \-algo xor is specified, the user must specify the key file to
encrypt with using the \-k or \-g option.
.PP
\f[B]\-sl, \-security\-level\f[R]
.PP
Specify the security level to use when hiding/extracting your file, it
can be one of the following:
.IP \(bu 2
high \- The most secure, uses 8 bytes of host data to store one byte of
your file.
.IP \(bu 2
medium \- Uses 4 bytes of host data to store one byte of your file.
.IP \(bu 2
low \- Not recommended, uses 2 bytes of host data to store 1 byte of
your file.
.PP
\f[B]\-k, \-key [key file]\f[R]
.PP
Supply a key file for XOR encryption, clk will abort with an error if
key file is smaller than your file you want to hide/extract.
If your intention is to use the key file as a One Time Pad (OTP), in
order to be secure, you must follow these 3 rules:
.IP "1." 3
The key must be truly random
.IP "2." 3
The key must be used \f[B]only\f[R] once
.IP "3." 3
The key must be at least as long as the file to encrypt (clk checks
this)
.PP
\f[B]\-g, \-generate [key file]\f[R]
.PP
This will generate random data the same length as your file to encrypt
with XOR encryption and save it to your key file, pfm will use the data
to encrypt your file before exiting, so can be used in the same way as
the \-k option.
See the \-k option for the rules around OTP encryption.
.PP
\f[B]\-c, \(encapacity\f[R]
.PP
Report the capacity of the host file specified with \-host at the
specified security level and exit.
.PP
\f[B]\(enversion, \-v\f[R]
.PP
Prints the version information of the clk program and exits.
.PP
\f[B]\(enhelp, \-?\f[R]
.PP
Prints the supported command line options and exits.
.SH EXAMPLES
To `cloak' file clk.dat using AES\-256 encryption within test.png using
the highest security level:
.PP
\f[CR]clk merge \-security\-level high \-algo aes \-host test.png clk.dat\f[R]
.PP
To `uncloak' file out.dat from test.png using AES\-256 encryption:
.PP
\f[CR]clk extract \-security\-level high \-algo aes \-host test.png out.dat\f[R]
.PP
To report the capacity of test.png using the highest security level:
.PP
\f[CR]clk merge \-security\-level high \-host test.png \-\-capacity\f[R]
